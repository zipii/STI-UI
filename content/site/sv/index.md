# Save the Internet

{: .title-subtext}
European Regulators are about to decide whether to give big telecoms corporations the power
to influence what we can (and can't) do online. Europe urgently needs clear net neutrality guidelines
to protect our freedoms and rights online. We have until __July__ to help Europe protect the open Internet.

## What needs to be fixed:

{{ BEGIN HOME SPECIALISED-SERVICES }}

### Specialised Services

Specialised Services risk becoming the paid fast-lane for big Internet companies that push every other website, idea and start-up into the slowlane.

{{ BEGIN HOME TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT }}

### Traffic Management

Don't let your Internet provider decide what traffic is important and which online services it slows down, at its own discretion.

### Zero Rating

It sounds like you get something for free, but it makes your mobile operator become a gatekeeper and gives it a reason for lower monthly data caps.

{{ ANCHOR INFO }}
## In 2015, the European Union adopted  legislation on net neutrality ...

[The EU Regulation](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32015R2120){: target="_blank" } contains good principles to ensure that you can connect to any other point on the net without discrimination. However, some parts of the regulation could be abused to undermine net neutrality. The legislators decided to leave the responsibility for claryifing the uncertainties of the text to the telecoms regulators.
{{ END HOME INFO }}


{{ BEGIN HOME BEREC-1 }}
The Body of European Regulators of Electronic Communications (BEREC) has to prepare implementation guidelines to interpret the ambiguities of the law by the end of August 2016. These guidelines will determine whether Europe will enjoy net neutrality or not.
{{ END HOME BEREC-1 }}

{{ BEGIN HOME BEREC-2 }}
In June 2016, BEREC plans to publish its draft guidelines and launch a public consultation. However, BEREC's procedural rules say that the public only has __from June 6th to July 18th__ to respond and the Regulation says that BEREC needs to publish its final guidelines on 30 August 2016. That means that citizens will only have __a few weeks__ to respond to the consultation and BEREC will only have __a little bit over a month__ to process the (potentially thousands of) comments, draft updates to its guidelines and then go through the administrative processes to formally agree to any changes that it makes to the draft.

## EU Net Neutrality Roadmap
{{ END HOME BEREC-3 }}

{{ BEGIN HOME BEREC-4 }}
### __This is a crucial moment: This is the step where big successes were achieved in the United States and India. Therefore, we have to continue pushing for real net neutrality by convincing the regulators about the value of a free and open Internet.__

Regulators need to equip themselves with the tools to enforce net neutrality. In Save The Internet, we think BEREC will not have enough time to process and duly take into account potentially tens of thousands of responses (the US telecoms regulator received 3.7 million responses to its consultation!). We can redress the balance by enabling everybody to properly contribute to the guidelines in a more efficient way.

Recently, BEREC organised face-to-face meetings with stakeholder groups. We have translated the questions that BEREC asked stakeholders ([see here](https://edri.org/edris-first-input-on-net-neutrality-guidelines/) and [here](https://www.accessnow.org/rekindling-net-neutrality-our-meeting-with-eus-telecoms-regulators/)) in those meetings into plain English and added few others when we felt this was necessary.
